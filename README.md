This is an app to allow easy aggregation of contests available in Canada in Canada. 
For example, there are many contests posted on public forums such as RedFlagDeals.com or ContestCanada.net, but it can sometimes be hard for the individual to keep track of all the contests he/she has entered. 
There are daily, weekly, hourly, every contest with their own unique methods. 
Saving the links and going back to all the daily entry contests is not really ideal, since it's a lot of manual work on the users end.

This app will let the user keep track of contests in an elegant and easy manner.
